My gameplan

Define MVP:
	Display 5 photos and a name. If photo is is selected and matches name, repeat

MVP Design:
	Make a request to the api
	Choose five random people and display their pictures
	Display one name
	onClick of picture, if name matches displayed name, add green border and after 5 seconds, display a new 5 people

Things to keep in mind:
	How do I want to store the api data?
